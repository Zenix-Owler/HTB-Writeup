# HackTheBox Writeups :
---
Writeups built by me which can give you the initial idea of how i successfully owned both user and root of some boxes that i tried to exploit. I do try to put the instructions as detailed and as step-by-step as possible, if there is any confusion, issue it as will.


### Structure of my Writeups :
---
  - ##### Requirements
    + Basic knowledge of some kind that you should know first before proceeding.
  - ##### Enumeration
    + Footprinting the target.
  - ##### Privilege Escalation
    + Escalate our current privilege to obtain the user.txt flag.
  - ##### Full Control
    + Rooting the server and obtain the root.txt flag.

### Logs :
